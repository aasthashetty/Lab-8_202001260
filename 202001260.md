## Unit Testing with JUnit

### Goal:
The goal of this lab is to learn how to use JUnit to write unit tests for Java programs.

### Lab Exercises
1. Create a new Eclipse project, and within the project create a package.

2. Create a class for a Boa. Here’s the code you can use (you may copy/paste):

> // represents a boa constrictor  
public class Boa {    
private String name;  
private int length; // the length of the boa, in feet    
private String favoriteFood;  
public Boa (String name, int length, String favoriteFood){    
this.name = name;  
this.length = length;    
this.favoriteFood = favoriteFood;  
}  
// returns true if this boa constrictor is healthy  
public boolean isHealthy(){    
return this.favoriteFood.equals("granola bars");    
}  
// returns true if the length of this boa constrictor is  
// less than the given cage length  
public boolean fitsInCage(int cageLength){  
return this.length < cageLength;  
}  
}

3. Follow the instructions in the JUnit tutorial in the section “Creating a JUnit Test Case in Eclipse”. You’ll be creating a test case for the class Boa. When you’re asked to select test method stubs, select both isHealthy() and fitsInCage(int).

4. Now it’s time to write some unit tests. Notice that the BoaTest class that JUnit created for you contains stubs for several methods. The first stub (for the method setUp()) is annotated with @Before. The @Before annotation denotes that the method setUp() will be run prior to the execution of each test method. setUp() is typically used to initialize data needed by each test. Modify the setUp() method so that it creates a couple of Boa objects, as follows:

@Before
public void setUp() throws Exception {
jen = new Boa("Jennifer", 2, "grapes");
ken = new Boa ("Kenneth", 3, "granola bars");
}

(You will need to add private fields for jen and ben to the BoaTest class, otherwise the compiler will complain that there are no variables with those names.)

> private Boa jen;  
private Boa ken;  

@Before  
public void setUp() throws Exception {  
jen = new Boa("Jennifer", 2, "grapes");  
ken = new Boa ("Kenneth", 3, "granola bars");  
}
